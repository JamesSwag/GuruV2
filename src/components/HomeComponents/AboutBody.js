                    <p><span className='Bold'>Guru the Caterer</span> has embarked on a new mission: Promote joy, flavor and nutrition through fresh, healthy and delicious food. At Guru the Caterer, food is cooked fresh in small batches every day. This keeps every day's menu fresh and also fits with our belief of avoiding needless wastage, even at the risk of some dishes running out before the close of business. We approach each day's menu like we are cooking for our family, but on a larger scale. The love we pour into making our food is readily apparent and cherished by all of our customers, many of whom return multiple times every week.</p>
